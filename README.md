# TCP-Chat-Project
To run the code, save both the Server.py and Client.py scripts to a folder as python files. Then  create a text file called bans.txt in that same location. Once all the files are set up navigate to the folder in command prompt and run the files through different instances of command prompt. One server file needs to be running then multiple client files can run and chat between each other. In addition to that functionality if you set your username to admin the program will prompt you to enter a password which is “adminpass” and then you will have admin privileges to be able to kick and ban people. Kicking people will simply remove them from the  chat and banning users will add their username to the block list and if they try to join back with that same username it will not allow them. In addition to this functionality users can direct message each other.

# Commands
